# Running the App

This app uses Rails 4.2.6. I built the app using Ruby 2.3.0 on my local machine. I'm managing my Ruby environment using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). Since I'm on Mac OS 10.11, I've installed rbenv through [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

If you need to get started from the ground up, the directions [here](https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.11-el-capitan) are pretty good. Once you're done make sure you also install [Bundler](http://bundler.io/). But hey, I'm not your boss. You do you. Just make sure you can run Rails.

Presuming you (a) know how to use Git and GitHub and (b) have Rails set up on your system, do the following to run the app:

1. Clone this repository to a directory on your local machine.
2. Once the repo is cloned, navigate to the root of the repo in Terminal.
3. Run `bundle install`.
4. Prepare the database by running `rake db:create`. (The DB used by the app is SQLite, which is the default DB created by every Rails project. So it should run without a problem.)
5. Migrate the database schema by running `rake db:migrate`.
6. Run `rails s` in the Terminal.
7. Profit!

# Importing Data

The application is designed to import data from a .csv file via the browser. In order to import a .csv, go to the root path `http://localhost:3000`, select your file, and click `Import`. Depending on the size of the CSV you are importing, the process can take several minutes.

The page will refresh once the import process is complete, notifying you once the import is successful:

## Data Restrictions

The DB schema is set to store all data values (with the exception of `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`) as strings. This is to preserve the integrity of certain values, particularly `zip` and `phone` values, which in some cases may begin with 0. Since the numbers in these fields are not being used to conduct mathematical operations, I decided to forego saving these values as integers.

### Additional Notes on Data Restrictions

1. The app is configured to validate all `uuid` values to be 36 characters in length. Any more or less will return a 422 status.
2. The `name`, `address`, `city`, `state`, and `country` are all validated by the app to be at least 2 characters in length.
3. The app validates the `zip` value to be at least 5 characters in length.
4. The app validates the `phone` value to be at least 10 characters in length.
5. The app validates the `website` value to be at least 7 characters in length (just enough for `http://`).
6. Any value length that does not meet the minimum requirements specified in 2-5 above will return a `HTTP 422 - unprocessable entity` status.
7. The only value that can be blank on creation or update is the `address2` value. If the value is blank, it will be saved to the database as `null`. This is the only allowable `null` value in the API.

# Authentication

Currently the API does not support authentication, making all records in the DB publicly accessible. This is likely to change in the future.

The app also skips verification of the Rails authenticity token, allowing for CRUD operations from external applications.

The authenticity token is NOT overlooked on CSV import. Any CSV import must be done from `http://localhost:3000` (which routes to `http://localhost:3000/businesses/new`).

# Endpoints

## Batches of Records

When accessing the API endpoint via a `GET` request to `http://localhost:3000/businesses`, the api will return a default batch of 50 records.

These defaults can be changed by use of a query string. In order to access a batch of records, add `http://localhost:3000/businesses?batch=X&page=Y`. X is the number of records you want to return while Y is the page you would like to start on.

Example: `http://localhost:3000/api/businesses?batch=100&page=3` will return 100 records starting at the 300th record.

There are four key-value pairs returned when accessing this endpoint, which depend on the values submitted in the query string:

```
{
	max_records_per_page: query_string_batch_value
	page: query_string_page_value
	total_records_returned: actual_records_returned
	businesses: [an_array_of_businesses]
}
```

`total_records_returned` indicates the actual number of business records returned. In most cases, this will only be different from `max_records_per_page` when it's the last page of available data. For example, if the DB has 147 records and the query string is `businesses?batch=50&page=3`, the result will read as follows:

```
{
	max_records_per_page: 50
	page: 3
	total_records_returned: 47
	businesses: [an_array_of_47_businesses]
}
```
The pagination metadata is only returned when accessing the API via the `/businesses` endpoint with a `GET` request.

### Notes on Retrieving Batches

The API does not support batches larger than 1000. Attempts to call batches larger than 1000 will return a 404. I've specifically added this limitation, modeling it on the Rails `.find_each` and `.find_in_batches` methods, which automatically set the retrieval limit to 1000. Thus, 1000 seemed to be an appropriate value, since it is consistent with default Active Record behavior in Rails.

This limit can easily be changed. On line 19 of `businesses_controller.rb`, change `limit = 1000` to `limit = your_limit_here`, where `your_limit_here` is the maximum number of records you want to retrieve at once.

**WARNING:** retrieving an ungodly number of records can crash the app. But you know that. Change the limit at your discretion.

## Specific Records

To retrieve a specific record, send a `GET` request to `http://localhost:3000/businesses/{:id}`, where `{:id}` is the database id of the record you wish to retrieve.

If the record does not exist, the API will return a 404 status with an error message of `Record not found.`

# Other CRUD Operations

Creating, updating, or destroying records can be done by sending an HTTP request with the appropriate verbs and data to the proper RESTful URL. Below are a few examples.

## Creating a New Record

In order to create a new record, send a POST request with JSON header information and data to the appropriate URL:

```
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST -d "{\"uuid\":\"c5b83c2d-a6ef-4e22-9d0e-f53cecae4105\",\"name\":\"Waterfield and Sons, LLC\",\"address\":\"4231 Beverly Blvd\",\"address2\":\"Suite 400\",\"city\":\"Whittier\",\"state\":\"CA\",\"zip\":\"90601\",\"country\":\"US\",\"phone\":5625559182,\"website\":\"http://www.waterfield-and-sons.net\"}" http://localhost:3000/businesses
```

### Notes on Creating New Records

1. The app validates the presence of `uuid`,`name`, `address`, `city`, `state`, `zip`, `country`, `phone`, and `website` on creation. If any of these values are blank or the key-value pair is missing from the JSON data, the record will not be created.
2. The app validates the length of each value. See **Additional Notes on Data Restrictions** above for details on required value lengths.

## Updating an Existing Record

To update an existing record, send a PUT request with JSON header information containing only the data you want to update to the appropriate URL:

```
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X PUT -d "{\"name\":\"Waterfield and Sons, Incorporated\",\"address\":\"2016 Valley View Ave\",\"address2\":\"\",\"city\":\"La Mirada\",\"state\":\"CA\",\"zip\":\"90604\"}" http://localhost:3000/api/businesses/{:id}
```

### Notes on Updating Records

1. Send ONLY the information you want to update. If you send a JSON key with an empty value, the API will return a `HTTP 422 - unprocessable entity` error along with a JSON response containing the list of errors, notifying you which fields cannot be blank.
2. You CAN send the `address2` field with an empty value. This will be saved to the database as a `NULL` field.
3. See **Additional Notes on Data Restrictions** above for details on required value lengths.

## Destroying an Existing Record

To destroy an existing record, send a DELETE request with JSON header information to the appropriate record URL:

```
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/businesses/{:id}
```

Because you're sending a DELETE request without any data, no validation takes place. It just gets nuked, like so:

# Testing

Testing is done via [rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails). All rspec dependencies should have been installed when you initially ran `bundle install` (see **Running the App** > Step 3).

The application only has request tests written, since it is designed as an API with virtually no user-facing capabilities.

The rspec tests have two defaults I manually set:

1. The rspec tests run in the Rails test environment.
2. When rspec is done running, it drops all records from the Test environment database. To change this, comment out lines 48-50 in `spec_helper.rb`.

Test coverage is included in `spec/requests/businesses_spec.rb`.

## Adding Test Coverage

If you want to expand the app's request coverage, simply add your desired test code to the `spec/requests/businesses_spec.rb` file.

If you want to run model, controller, view, or feature specs, you can follow the [rspec documentation](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails) to add those tests.

## Running Tests

To run the rspec tests, do the following:

1. Make sure your Rails server is not running (`Ctrl+C`).
2. Make sure you are in the app's root folder.
3. Run `rspec spec/requests`.
4. You should see green â€“ the color of SUCCESS. And the Hulk. Smashing! (Unless, of course, you wrote a test that's failing. But whose fault is that?)
